## **DESCRIPTION**

## A gemstone price prediction project typically involves using machine learning techniques to analyze various factors that influence the price of gemstones, such as carat weight, clarity, color, cut, and other characteristics. The goal is to build a model that can accurately predict the price of a gemstone based on these factors.

## This project usually starts by collecting a dataset that includes information about the gemstones, such as their characteristics and corresponding prices. This dataset is then used to train a machine learning model, such as a regression model, that learns the patterns and relationships between the input features (characteristics) and the target variable (price).

## Once the model is trained, it can be used to make predictions on new, unseen gemstones. The accuracy of the predictions can be evaluated using various metrics, such as mean squared error or R-squared.

## **Input Features**

* ### `Carat` : Carat (ct.) refers to the unique unit of weight measurement used exclusively to weigh gemstones and diamonds.
* ### `Depth` : The depth of diamond is its height (in millimeters) measured from the culet (bottom tip) to the table (flat, top surface).
* ### `Table` : A diamond's table is the facet which can be seen when the stone is viewed face up.
* ### `Cut` : Quality of Diamond Cut.
* ### `Color` : Color of Diamond.
* ### `Clarity` : Diamond clarity is a measure of the purity and rarity of the stone, graded by the visibility of these characteristics under 10-power magnification.
